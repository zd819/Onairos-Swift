# Onairos Swift SDK - Fixes Summary

This document tracks all fixes and improvements made to the Onairos Swift SDK.

## Recent Fixes

### PIN Submission Timeout and Crash Fix (2024-12-28)

**Problem**: PIN submission was timing out after 30 seconds and causing app crashes.

**Root Cause**: 
- Default 30-second timeout was too short for PIN submission
- Insufficient error handling and retry mechanism
- No crash protection around PIN submission process
- Poor user feedback during submission process

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Extended Timeout Configuration**:
   - Increased PIN submission timeout to 60 seconds (request) and 120 seconds (resource)
   - Created dedicated `performPINSubmissionWithTimeout()` method with custom URLSession

2. **Retry Mechanism**:
   - Added automatic retry up to 3 attempts with 2-second delays
   - Intelligent retry logic that only retries for network/server errors
   - Enhanced error categorization to determine retry eligibility

3. **Crash Protection**:
   - Added error boundaries around PIN storage and submission
   - Implemented `submitPINToBackendSafely()` wrapper with try-catch
   - Graceful handling of unexpected errors with user-friendly messages

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error mapping with specific user messages
   - Differentiated between recoverable and non-recoverable errors
   - Smart decision making on whether to proceed or retry

5. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Better visual feedback during submission process
   - Success animations and color-coded button states
   - Retry button functionality for failed submissions
   - Clear progress indicators and status messages

6. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Temporary verbose logging during PIN submission for debugging
   - Detailed request/response logging with sensitive data protection
   - Comprehensive error context and recovery suggestions

**Files Modified**:
- `Sources/OnairosSDK/Network/OnairosAPIClient.swift`: Enhanced submitPIN method with retry and timeout
- `Sources/OnairosSDK/UI/PINStepViewController.swift`: Improved UI feedback and error handling
- `Sources/OnairosSDK/Models/OnairosError.swift`: Extended error categorization

**Backend Compatibility**:
- Endpoint: `/store-pin/mobile` (matches backend route)
- Request format: `{"username": "string", "pin": "string"}`
- Response format: `{"success": boolean, "message": "string", "userId": "string", ...}`

**Testing Recommendations**:
1. Test with slow network connections
2. Test with network interruptions during submission
3. Test server timeout scenarios
4. Test retry functionality
5. Verify crash protection works

### Previous Fixes

### BiometricPINManager Module Visibility Fix (2024-12-28)

**Problem**: BiometricPINManager and related types were not accessible due to module scope issues.

**Solution**: 
- Moved BiometricPINError and BiometricAvailability types to OnboardingModels.swift
- Fixed module accessibility and removed duplicate definitions
- Added comprehensive logging for biometric authentication testing

**Files Modified**:
- `Sources/OnairosSDK/Models/OnboardingModels.swift`: Added biometric types
- `Sources/OnairosSDK/Core/BiometricPINManager.swift`: Removed duplicate types
- `Sources/OnairosSDK/UI/PINStepViewController.swift`: Updated type references

### EmailVerificationResponse Build Error Fix (2024-12-28)

**Problem**: Compilation error "Value of type 'EmailVerificationResponse' has no member 'accountInfo'"

**Solution**: Added missing `accountInfo: [String: AnyCodable]?` property to EmailVerificationResponse struct

**Files Modified**:
- `Sources/OnairosSDK/Models/OnboardingModels.swift`: Added accountInfo property

### PIN Submission Format Fix (2024-12-28)

**Problem**: PIN submission format didn't match backend API requirements

**Solution**: 
- Updated PIN submission endpoint to `/store-pin/mobile` 
- Simplified PIN request payload to only include username and pin
- Added proper JWT authentication support

**Files Modified**:
- `Sources/OnairosSDK/Network/OnairosAPIClient.swift`: Updated submitPIN method
- `Sources/OnairosSDK/Models/OnboardingModels.swift`: Updated PINSubmissionRequest

## Testing Status

- ✅ BiometricPINManager integration verified
- ✅ EmailVerificationResponse compilation fixed
- ✅ PIN submission format updated
- ✅ PIN timeout and crash protection implemented
- ⏳ End-to-end PIN submission testing in progress

## Next Steps

1. Test the enhanced PIN submission with various network conditions
2. Verify backend compatibility with new retry mechanism
3. Monitor crash reports to ensure protection is effective
4. Consider adding offline PIN submission queue for future enhancement
