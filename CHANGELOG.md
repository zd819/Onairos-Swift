- Updated all API method calls to use appropriate specific performRequest methods

### Changed
- Updated integration guide with Swift 6.1 compatibility information
- Enhanced troubleshooting with specific Swift 6.1 error solutions
- Added comprehensive error-to-solution mapping for generic type inference issues

### Notes
- **BREAKING**: Versions 1.0.1-1.0.8 had compilation issues with Swift 6.1
