## [1.0.17] - 2024-12-28

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Test Mode Flow**: Fixed test mode closing immediately after email step instead of showing full onboarding flow
  - Test mode now properly shows: Email ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Success ‚Üí PIN ‚Üí Training ‚Üí Completion
  - Fixed premature dismissal that was happening after email verification
  - Slowed down training simulation in test mode (10 seconds instead of 0.8 seconds)
  - Extended completion delay so users can see training completion screen (3 seconds vs 0.8 seconds)

### Enhanced
- **Test Mode Debugging**: Added comprehensive debug logging for each onboarding step
  - Email step: Logs accepted email and transition to verify step
  - Verify step: Logs accepted verification code and transition to connect step
  - Connect step: Logs platform connection skip and auto-advance timing
  - Success step: Logs transition to PIN step
  - PIN step: Logs accepted PIN and transition to training step
  - Training step: Logs simulation start, progress, and completion timing

### Technical
- **Timing Improvements**: Optimized test mode timing for better user experience
  - Training simulation increment: 0.015 (slower) vs 0.04 (was too fast)
  - Training completion delay: 3.0 seconds vs 0.8 seconds (better visibility)
  - Connect step auto-advance: 2.0 seconds vs 1.0 second (improved visibility)
  - Overall test flow duration: ~15 seconds vs ~3 seconds (proper demonstration time)

## [1.0.18] - 2024-12-28

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Swift Compilation Errors**: Fixed "Reference to property 'config' in closure requires explicit use of 'self'" errors
  - Added explicit `self.` to all config references in timer closures
  - Fixed Swift strict concurrency requirements for closure capture semantics
  - Resolved all compilation errors preventing builds

### Enhanced
- **Connect Step User Experience**: Improved connect step to require manual user interaction
  - Removed confusing auto-advance behavior (was auto-skipping after 2-3 seconds)
  - Connect step now shows UI and waits for user to press "Continue" or "Skip" button
  - Added `handleConnectStepProceed()` method for manual progression
  - Better user control over onboarding flow progression

### Changed
- **Connect Step Flow**: Updated step navigation behavior
  - **Before**: Auto-advanced after 2-3 seconds (confusing for users)
  - **After**: Shows connect screen, user presses button to proceed
  - **Test Mode**: User can manually proceed without connecting any platforms
  - **Debug Mode**: User can manually proceed if they have connections or skip if allowed
  - **Production**: User must connect platforms OR manually skip if `allowEmptyConnections` is enabled

### Clarified
- **Success Step Purpose**: Documented the success step between Connect and PIN
  - Success step shows brief "Success!" message after connecting platforms
  - Provides positive feedback before moving to PIN creation
  - Auto-advances to PIN step after 1.5-2 seconds (intended behavior)
  - This step provides visual confirmation of successful platform connections

### Technical
- **Test Mode Logging**: Enhanced debugging output for connect step flow
  - `üß™ [TEST MODE] Connect step ready - user can manually proceed`
  - `üß™ [TEST MODE] User manually proceeding from connect step`
  - `üß™ [TEST MODE] Moving to success step`
  - `üß™ [TEST MODE] Auto-advancing from success to PIN step`

  - Added comprehensive NaN and infinite value protection throughout training progress system
  - Prevents app crashes from invalid numeric values in UI rendering components

  - External API protection: All incoming progress values validated before state assignment
  - Training completion: Ensured exactly 1.0 value with no possibility of NaN
  - Model-level validation: TrainingProgress constructor validates percentage parameter

### Stability
